# WAN Topology Project

**Project Overview:** This hands-on project is designed to teach participants how to set up a Wide Area Network (WAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing specifically on the foundational skills of network configuration. Through step-by-step instructions, you will learn to use Cisco IOS commands to configure network devices, set up interfaces, implement static routing, and establish reliable connections between two separate LANs.***This project is for educational purposes only***:

## Topology Configuration

Below is a detailed walkthrough of the WAN Topology Configuration project, including images and videos to guide you through each step.

### Step 1: Topology

This step involves understanding and setting up the topology of the network. The topology defines how different nodes and devices are arranged and interconnected in the network to support communication.

### Step 2: Configure Router 1

In this step, you will configure Router 1 to establish the initial settings and prepare it for connectivity.

### Step 3: Configure Router 2

Configure Router 2 to complete the initial setup and ensure it is ready for network operations.

### Step 4: Configure PC 1

Set up the network configuration for PC 1, ensuring it has the correct IP settings for communication.

### Step 5: Configure PC 2

Configure PC 2 to finalize its network setup with appropriate IP settings.

### Step 6: Attempt to ping PC 2 from PC 1

This step demonstrates an initial ping attempt from PC 1 to PC 2, which should show connectivity issues without proper routing.

### Step 7: Configure Static Route on Router 1

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b35f40e9-6795-4465-b7ca-cc591ad9f067

Set up a static route on Router 1 to enable communication between networks.

### Step 8: Configure Static Route on Router 2

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b0f68d7-b69c-4b59-a9a8-2ed0e01fe988

Configure a static route on Router 2 to complete the routing setup and facilitate network connectivity.

### Step 9: Successful Ping
