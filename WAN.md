## WAN Topology Configuration

Below is a detailed walkthrough of the WAN Topology Configuration project, including images and videos to guide you through each step.

### Step 1: Topology

This step involves understanding and setting up the topology of the network. The topology defines how different nodes and devices are arranged and interconnected in the network to support communication.

### Step 2: Configure Router 1

This step demonstrates an initial ping attempt from PC 1 to PC 2, which should show connectivity issues without proper routing.

### Step 7: Configure Static Route on Router 1
